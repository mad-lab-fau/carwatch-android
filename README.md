# CARWatch
CARWatch is an Android application for objectively saliva sampling times during 
cortisol awakening response (CAR) studies.


## Objective
The CAR is the natural increase in cortisol levels that occurs within 30-45 minutes after waking up 
and can be an important indicator for overall health and well-being.

However, many CAR studies suffer from low adherence to the study protocol as well as from the 
lack of precise and objective methods for assessing the awakening and saliva sampling times which 
leads to measurement bias on CAR quantification. This issue can be solved by *CARWatch*, an Android
application that allows for objective saliva sampling times during CAR studies.


## Features
The main purpose of the application is to reduce saliva sampling inaccuracies by 
objectively assessing saliva sampling times during CAR assessment. 

CARWatch includes the following features:
* Awakening time assessment: Awakening can be assessed either by setting an alarm by the user 
  or by pressing a button in the application in the case of spontaneous awakening.
* Saliva sampling time assessment: Saliva sampling times are recorded by setting alarms for 
  each saliva sample which can only be turned off by scanning a barcode on the saliva sampling tube.
* Data export: All data collected by CARWatch can be exported which can be used for 
  further analysis.

## Getting Started
